# metadata_in_photo
<hr>
To view the metadata of photos or pictures, you need to put them in the same folder with the script.
The script displays the basic file information and metadata (the device on which the photo was taken, camera, geolocation) to the terminal. I think this is enough for now. Maybe add another metadata search.
